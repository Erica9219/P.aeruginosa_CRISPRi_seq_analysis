# CRISPRi-seq for Gallium Synergy Target Identification in Pseudomonas aeruginosa
Author: Tingting Zhang [zhangtingting9218@163.com]

This repository contains an R-based software package developed for the analysis of CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) and genome-wide screening sequencing data in Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The method enables the quantitative measurement of gene essentiality and the identification of genes that interact with non-antibiotic therapies, such as gallium.

sgRNA Design:
The sgRNA design for CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) in this repository follows the pipeline outlined in the CRISPRi-seq repository. This pipeline automates the design of highly specific and efficient single-guide RNAs (sgRNAs) for gene knockdown in bacterial genomes.

Scripts:
The scripts used to generate individual figure panels, as well as for data processing and analysis.
