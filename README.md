# CRISPRi-seq for Gallium Synergy Target Identification in Pseudomonas aeruginosa


This repository contains an R-based software package analysized for CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) and genome-wide screening sequenceing data in Pseudomonas aeruginosa. This method enables the quantitative measurement of gene essentiality and identification of genes that interact with non-antibiotic therapies such as gallium.
